OOPS : object oriented programming structure. 


Class : class is a keyword
 		a blueprint of object
 		is a collection of object
 		combination of variables and methods

Object : created with "new" keyword.
		 its a runtime entity
		 is an instance of class
		 describes states, properties and behavior of class
		 Employee e1 = new Employee
		 Employee is a class and e1 is an object of class Employee

Inheritence : access properties from one class through other
			  is a parent child relationship
			  parent- base or super class
			  child- derived or sub class
			  
			  single inheritence : one parent one child    1->1
			  multi inheritence : one grandfather one parent one child 1->1->1
			  hierarchical inheritence : one parent more child  1->many
			   

Polymorphism : one name many forms
				poly - many
				morphism - behavior
				reusability
				Overloading : compile time/ static
				methods have same name with diff parameters
				Overriding : runtime/ dynamic
				methods have same name with same parameters
